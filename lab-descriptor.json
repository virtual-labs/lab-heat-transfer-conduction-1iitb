    "introduction": "The term Heat is used for the energy which becomes mobile as a result of temperature difference between two locations. The topic Heat Transfer deals with the study of different ways or modes of heat flow and estimation of rate of flow in these modes. Flow of energy is the main cause behind occurrence of any process in the world.Naturally the energy always flows from a higher temperature region to a lower temperature region. In a broad sense, there are three modes of heat transfer namely Conduction, Convection and Radiation. Heat transfer deals with the effect of material / fluid properties and temperature gradient on heat flow.",
